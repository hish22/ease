## Description

Ease is a lightweight, flexible template engine built with PHP, designed to streamline and enhance the development of dynamic PHP applications. It offers a modular architecture centered around fundamental components called "eases," where each ease represents a distinct element or factor within the page structure. This approach promotes clean separation of concerns, enabling developers to manage layout, logic, and content more efficiently.

Templates created with Ease use the .ease.php file extension, clearly distinguishing them from standard PHP files and ensuring better organization within your project structure.

## prerequisites

`Ease needs at least PHP 8.x.x to work.`

## Engine Architecture

The core of the Ease Template Engine is its main component: the Engine. The Engine itself is composed of several subcomponents, with the most critical being the Summon entity.

</p>

**Summon**

The Summon entity serves as the central entry point and orchestrator of the engine's functionality. It is comprised of three primary classes:

1. **Entry**
   Acts as the main entry point of the engine. It is responsible for locating and opening the view folder to access .ease.php template files.

2. **Fetcher**
   Handles the process of reading and fetching the lines of code from the Ease template files. It prepares the content for transformation into the appropriate PHP script.

3. **Extractor**
   Extracts the necessary logic and script from the parsed Ease templates. This component interprets the logic within the templates and ensures it integrates correctly with the resulting PHP output.

**Construction**

After completing its operations, the Entry class triggers the ConstructPHP process, which belongs to the Construction component of the engine. This step initiates the construction of the final PHP file based on the extracted logic and structure.

</p>

**Buffer**

The Buffer component is responsible for storing the parsed content of the Ease file. It acts as temporary memory during processing, allowing the engine to manipulate and structure the content before rendering.

**Render**

The Render component provides the core rendering functionality of the engine. It is tasked with displaying the final parsed and processed content stored PHP file, outputting it as a valid PHP response.

**Optimize**

Optimize is the component responsible for detecting changes in content using the MD5 hash technique. It helps prevent unnecessary parsing by skipping processing if the content has not changed.

## Documentation

### Bootstrap.php or index.php

This is the main entry file of the system:

```php
<?php

/**
 * USE THE MAIN RENDER FUNCTION
 */
use function Engine\Render\Render;

/**
 * INCLUDE THE ENGINE UTILITIES
 */
include_once 'Engine/ease-engine.php';


$eng = EaseEngine::BuildEaseEngine();

$eng->full();

$list = [
    'users' => [
        'user1' => [
            'age' => 12
        ],
        'user2' => [
            'age' => 15
        ]
    ],
    'name' => 'dude'
];

render("home",$list);

```

render is the main function to render the ease file itself.

### Example Usage of the Ease Template Engine

Below is a simple example demonstrating how an Ease template file might look:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    ~print('Hello world') // This is a sample of printing data.
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the ~print('Hello world') line represents an ease processed by the Ease Template Engine. During rendering, the engine will interpret this line and output:

```
Hello world
```

### Configuration

Each Ease template project includes a configuration file that defines how the engine should behave. Below is an example configuration file in JSON format:

```json
{
  "main": {
    "Producation": false,
    "ParseType": "full"
  },
  "error": {
    "formatPHP": true
  },
  "location": {
    "views": "views"
  }
}
```

- Main Section

  This section controls core behavior of the engine:

  **Production:** When set to true, the engine disables parsing to improve performance in a production environment. If false, parsing is enabled for development.

  **ParseType:** Defines the scope of parsing:

  `"full"`: Parses all .ease.php files in the views directory.

  `"partial"`: Parses only the selected file and any included Ease files.

  `"single"`: Parses only a specific file, giving the developer full control.

- Error Section

  Handles error formatting options:

  **formatPHP:** When true, any PHP errors that occur during parsing or rendering will be formatted and displayed in a more readable form, improving debugging during development.

- Location Section

  Specifies the directory structure:

  **views:** Defines the path to the folder containing the .ease.php view templates.

### Error handling

The Ease Template Engine provides a structured error handling mechanism designed to assist developers in identifying and resolving issues during parsing and rendering. It supports two types of error detection:

1. Block-Type Errors

Block-type error handling scans the entire template file to detect structural issues, especially those related to the use of opening and closing tags (e.g., unbalanced or missing control structures). This type is ideal for catching errors that affect the overall integrity of the document.

2. Line-Type Errors

Line-type error handling focuses on detecting issues that occur within a single line. These are usually syntax-related or caused by misuse of template eases.

### Common Exceptions and Error Messages

The following are predefined exceptions handled by the engine:

- Duplicated Inclusion

  `Invalid include of same file!`

  Triggered when the same Ease file is included more than once improperly.

- Invalid Parameters

  `Regular eases can't have arguments!`

  Raised when a regular Ease template is passed arguments, which is not allowed.

- Null Arguments

  `Null argument value provided!`

  Occurs when an ease receives an argument with a null value.

- Null Parameters

  `Null file location provided!`

  Thrown when an include or reference is made to a file without a valid path.

- Unset Parentheses

  `Can't print empty parentheses`

  Happens when a print or logic ease is called without any expression inside the parentheses.

- Wrong Inclusion

  `No such ease file!`

  Raised when the engine cannot locate the referenced Ease file.

### Types of Eases in the Ease Template Engine

Eases are the core components in the Ease Template Engine. They are categorized into two types based on their behavior and purpose:

1. Control Eases

Control eases are responsible for managing logic flow within templates. They handle conditional statements, loops, and block-level logic structures. These eases typically wrap around or control other content within the template.

Examples:

- ~if(...) / ~endif ‚Äî for conditional logic

- ~loop(...) / ~endloop ‚Äî for loops

2. Dynamic Eases

Dynamic eases are focused on generating and returning executable PHP code. They do not control flow but rather inject or render values and logic inline.

Examples:

- ~print(...) ‚Äî outputs data
- ~head - return http input tag

### Template eases

- üß† Control Eases

`~if(condition)`

Description: Starts a conditional block based on the given expression.

```php
~if($user->isLoggedIn)
    ~print('Welcome back!')
~endif
```

`~loop(iterable) or ~loop(iterable as item)`

Description: Iterates over an array or iterable object.

```php
~loop($users as $user)
    ~print($user)
~endloop
```

Other example:

```php
~loop($users)
    ~print($user)
~endloop
```

`~filter(iterable => condition) or ~filter((iterable as item) => condition)`

Description: Applies a specified filter to the data.

```php
~filter(($products as $product) => $product == 'orange')
    <p>~PRINT($product)</p>
~endfilter
```

Other examples:

```php
~filter($users => $user > 10)
    <p>~PRINT($user)</p>
~endfilter
```

```php
~filter([1,2,3,4] as $num => $num > 1)
    ~print($num)
~endfilter
```

- ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Eases

**HTTP methods hidden input:**

example:

```html
<input type="hidden" value="GET" name="_method" />
```

`~GET or ~get`

Description: Generates a hidden input indicating the HTTP GET method.

```php
~get
```

`~POST or ~post`

Description: Generates a hidden input indicating the HTTP POST method.

```php
~post
```

`~PUT or ~put`

Description: Generates a hidden input indicating the HTTP PUT method.

```php
~put
```

`~DELETE or ~delete`

Description: Generates a hidden input indicating the HTTP DELETE method.

```php
~delete
```

`~HEAD or ~head`
Description: Generates a hidden input indicating the HTTP HEAD method.

```php
~head
```

`~PATCH or ~patch`

Description: Generates a hidden input indicating the HTTP PATCH method.

```php
~patch
```

**Print and echo content**

`~print(expression) or ~PRINT(expression)`

Description: Outputs the evaluated result of the expression.

```php
~print('hello world')
```

**Include other ease file content:**

`~INCLUDE filename or ~include filename`

Description: Includes another .ease.php file into the current template.

Note: Triggers parsing of the included file and merges its output.

```php
~INCLUDE test/about
~include way
```

### Case Insensitivity

Ease template syntax is case-insensitive, meaning that eases can be written in either lowercase or uppercase ‚Äî or a mix of both ‚Äî without affecting functionality.

```php
~print('Hello')
~PRINT('Hello')
~PrInT('Hello')
```

### Comments

You can prevent specific lines or content from being parsed by the Ease Template Engine by using `//` at the beginning of the line. This allows you to include notes or temporarily disable ease logic without affecting the rendering process.

```php
// ~print('This will not be parsed or rendered')
```

### Raw PHP Execution

`~{}`

the ~{} syntax is used to embed and execute raw PHP code within ease templates.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, ~{} only supports single-line PHP statements. Multi-line code blocks are not supported at this time.

```php
~{ echo "Current year: " . date('Y'); }
```

## üìå Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to enhance my proficiency in coding and problem-solving through practical implementation. By developing this template engine, I aimed to deepen my understanding of engine architecture, parsing mechanisms, and PHP internals. While the project may continue to evolve, its core intention remains focused on personal growth and technical skill development.
